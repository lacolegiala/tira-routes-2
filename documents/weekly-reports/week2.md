# Week 2

## What has been done

I've read more about IDA*, which I will use in my project for finding shortest paths.

Unfortunately I didn't have much time this week, so there isn't really any code.
I could use some tips on what kind of map data to use. I've been thinking that there should be some sort of 
graph that represents a map which has nodes that represent addresses, but I'm not sure how to implement this.
Should I use some sort of map API suitable for using with IDA*? Or should I just create an imaginary, hard-coded map?
If I were to make a map by myself, would it make sense for the nodes to be just street names
(for example Eerikinkatu and Albertinkatu), or should the addresses be more specific?

## Plans for next week

Next week there will hopefully be some mvp version of the algorithm implemented.
I will also catch up on everything that I missed this week.

## Time spent

About 3 hours.
