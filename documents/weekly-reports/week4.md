# Week 4

## What has been done
I have started playing with map data in order to use it with the project. I also discarded the
old project because of some Java issues. Trying solving them just took too much time. Because I have made some changes on my schedule,
I am now able to focus more on the project and hopefully will get it done.

## Hours spent

About 8 hours.
