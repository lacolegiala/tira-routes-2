# Week 6

## What has been done

IDA* has now been implemented in the application, however I'm not sure if it works 100% right.
In some cases, the routes look to be a little off, but I'm not sure what causes it.

## Hours spent

Had a bit of a crazy week so unfortunately I don't remember exactly. Rough estimation is 16 hours.
