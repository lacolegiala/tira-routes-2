# Week 3

## What has been done

I've been searching more about the subject and also talked about it with the teacher. 
I'm uncertain if this is the right subject for me after all. Would it be possible to change the subject at this point?
If so, what would be simple enough to be doable before the deadline? I'll have more time for this project starting next week
(I've been in a semi-vacation for the past 2 weeks so that has impacted on my schedule).

## Time spent

Around 2 hours.
