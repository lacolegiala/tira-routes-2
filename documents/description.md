# Shortest/fastest routes

## Topic
The goal of this project is to make a program that finds the most efficient route between two points.

## Data structures and algorithms
JPS, IDA* and fringe search will most likely be included.

## Problem
There are often basically endless number of possible routes between two points. The goal is to find the most efficient one. I chose the forementioned data structures and algorithms because they were linked in the material, so they should be suitable.

## Inputs
Inputs given to the program would be either addresses or coordinates.

## Time and space requirements
Time and space requirements are not yet defined.

## Study programme
Bachelor of Computer Science

## Languages
The programming language will be Java. I'm also very familiar with JavaScript/TypeScript, and I know Python well enough to review other students' work.

The documents will be written in English.
