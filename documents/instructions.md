## How to use

Run the MapApplication. A UI window will open.

Choose the coordinates by giving numbers between 1-512 to the start and target coordinate inputs.
Unfortunately, as of now, there is no user feedback on the UI whenever a blocked point is chosen.
The user has to adjust their coordinate so that it is not blocked.

You can see the routes calculated by JPS and A* by pressing their buttons after the coordinates are set.
The heuristic values can also be adjusted if wanted, although according to my understanding
1 and square root of 2 would be recommended, and that's why they are the default values.
